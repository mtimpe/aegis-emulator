## Advanced Emulation for Giant Impact Simulations

&AElig;GIS is a pipeline to construct a set of optimized emulators for pairwise collisions 
between planetary-sized bodies. It uses automated machine learning to choose the best 
emulation method and architecture for the quantity of interest. Instead of simply providing 
a pre-trained emulator, we provide this pipeline to facilitate emulation from alternate datasets.
