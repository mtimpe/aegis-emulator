## Advanced Emulation for Giant Impact Simulations

#### Miles Timpe, Maria Han Veiga, Mischa Knabenhans, Joachim Stadel and Stefano Marelli

&AElig;GIS is a machine learning pipeline for creating optimized regression 
models (i.e., emulators) that can predict the outcome of collisions between
planets. Each model predicts a specific post-impact property of the collision.

The data comes from 10,700 smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations
of pairwise collisions between rotating, differentiated planets. The collision
simulations and associated machine learning pipeline are from Timpe et al. 2020 
(in review). The simulation data is publicly available on the
[Dryad open research repository](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.j6q573n94 "Dryad repository").
